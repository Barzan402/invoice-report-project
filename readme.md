# Invoice Report Project

This project is a Java based invoice reporting system developed as part of an
in class project for CSCE 156 Computer Science II.

The project applies object oriented programming principles to model real world
business data and generate structured invoice reports.

## Project Overview
The system represents business entities such as customers, companies, materials,
equipment, and contracts. These entities are used to construct invoices and
produce organized invoice summaries and reports.

The design shows clean class structure, separation of responsibilities,
and readable, maintainable Java code.

## Concepts Used
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- Domain modeling of business entities
- Data parsing and transformation
- Separation of data loading, processing, and reporting logic
- Database connectivity using JDBC
- Relational database usage with MySQL
- Unit testing with JUnit

## Technologies Used
- Java
- MySQL Workbench
- JDBC
- Eclipse IDE
- JUnit
- Git & GitHub
